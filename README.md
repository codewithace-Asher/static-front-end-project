<h2 align="center">Hello and Welcome :</h2>

<p align="center">This project is a responsive website that incorporates all of the skills learned so far in the course, as well as inspiration from a variety of developers I've met along the way on my coding journey. This website will showcase the skills and knowledge I've acquired while trading and working as an education consultant. It allows users to communicate easily, is visually appealing, and is simple to use.</p><br>

<h2 align="left">Deployment :</h2>
"With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, I crafted this static website using nothing but the power of HTML and CSS, utilizing Dreamweaver as my trusty tool of creation. To ensure that my progress was well documented and easily accessible to my team, I made use of GitHub Desktop, committing and pushing my code on a daily basis - a true testament to my dedication to the project."

<h3 align="center">Personal Acknowledgment :</h3>
"As I sit back and admire the completed website before me, I am filled with a sense of accomplishment and pride. Being my first ever attempt at writing code, this website represents a significant milestone for me. I am humbled by the journey and enjoying every moment of it. I relied on my education and resources such as Code + Learning People Global and YouTube videos and tutorials to guide me along the way. But what truly brought this website to life was my own creativity, patience, and dedication to the project. With each obstacle I encountered, I reminded myself that practice makes perfect and pushed through to achieve my goal. This website is a true testament to the power of self-motivation, perseverance and the ability to learn new things, and a shining example of what can be achieved through self-education, hard work and the use of platforms like Code + Learning People Global."
