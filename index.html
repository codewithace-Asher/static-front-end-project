        <h3 class="clear">Price Action</h3><br>
        <p>Price action is a technique used in technical analysis that examines the movement of security prices over time, rather than relying on indicators or other forms of analysis. It looks at the price changes on charts, and uses patterns and trends to make predictions about future movements.Price action traders believe that the study of past price movements can help predict future price movements.</p><br>
		  <p> They look for patterns, trends, and other market characteristics that can provide clues about the direction of the market.The basic idea behind price action is that market participants, such as traders and investors, leave their footprints on charts in the form of price movements.</p>

		<p>It is important to note that market structure analysis is not a perfect or infallible method and can be affected by unforeseen circumstances. Therefore, it's a good idea to combine it with other methods of analysis and not to rely on it solely.</p><br>
